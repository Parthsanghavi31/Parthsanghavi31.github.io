I am a second-year master's student in Robotics at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/). I am part of the [PAL group](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~dineshj/pal/index.html) advised by [Prof. Dinesh Jayaraman](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~dineshj/) and [Prof. Osbert Bastani](https://obastani.github.io/).

I am broadly interested in reinforcement learning applied to robotics settings. I aim to develop robust learning methods for robotic tasks that generalize to complex unstructured, and novel environments. 

I completed my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at [Amrita University](https://www.amrita.edu/), where I worked on automotive engineering projects.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
